            <p>
                Identifiers use only ASCII letters and digits, and, in a small number of cases noted below,
                underscores and very rarely (when required by frameworks like Angular) dollar signs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Give as descriptive a name as possible, within reason.
                Do not worry about saving horizontal space as it is far more important to make your code immediately
                understandable by a new reader.
                Do not use abbreviations that are ambiguous or unfamiliar to readers outside your project,
                and do not abbreviate by deleting letters within a word.
            </p>
            <code>
                errorCount // No abbreviation.
                dnsConnectionIndex // Most people know what "DNS" stands for.
                referrerUrl // Ditto for "URL".
                customerId // "Id" is both ubiquitous and unlikely to be misunderstood.
            </code>
            <p>Disallowed</p>
            <code>
                n // Meaningless.
                nErr // Ambiguous abbreviation.
                nCompConns // Ambiguous abbreviation.
                wgcConnections // Only your group knows what this stands for.
                pcReader // Lots of things can be abbreviated "pc".
                cstmrId // Deletes internal letters.
                kSecondsPerDay // Do not use Hungarian notation.

            <header>Package names</header>
            <p>
                Package names are all lowerCamelCase. For example, my.exampleCode.deepSpace, but not
                <code>my.examplecode.deepspace</code> or <code>my.example_code.deep_space</code>.
            </p>

            <header>Class names</header>
            <p>
                Class, interface, record, and typedef names are written in UpperCamelCase.
                Unexported classes are simply locals:
                they are not marked @private and therefore are not named with a trailing underscore.
            </p>
            <p>
                Type names are typically nouns or noun phrases.
                For example, Request, ImmutableList, or VisibilityMode.
                Additionally, interface names may sometimes be adjectives or adjective phrases instead (for example,
                Readable).
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Method_names" class="main-section">
            <header>Method names</header>
            <p>
                Method names are written in lowerCamelCase. Names for @private methods must end with a trailing underscore.
            </p>
            <p>
                Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases. For example, sendMessage or stop_. Getter and setter
                methods for properties are never required, but if they are used they should be named getFoo (or optionally
                isFoo or hasFoo for booleans), or setFoo(value) for setters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Underscores may also appear in JsUnit test method names to separate logical components of the name. One
                typical pattern is test <code>{MethodUnderTest}_{state}_{expectedOutcome}</code>, for example testPop_emptyStack_throws.
                There is no One Correct Way to name test methods.

        <section id="Enum_names" class="main-section">
            <header>Enum names</header>
            <p>
                Enum names are written in UpperCamelCase, similar to classes, and should generally be singular nouns.
                Individual items within the enum are named in CONSTANT_CASE.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Constant_names" class="main-section">
            <header>Constant names</header>
            <p>
                Constant names use CONSTANT_CASE: all uppercase letters, with words separated by underscores.
                There is no reason for a constant to be named with a trailing underscore,
                since private static properties can be replaced by (implicitly private) module locals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every constant is a @const static property or a module-local const declaration,
                but not all @const static properties and module-local consts are constants.
                Before choosing constant case, consider whether the field really feels like a deeply immutable constant.
                For example, if any of that instance's observable state can change,
                it is almost certainly not a constant. Merely intending to never mutate the object is generally not enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                Examples:
            </p>
            <code>
                // Constants
                const NUMBER = 5;
                /** @const */ exports.NAMES = ImmutableList.of('Ed', 'Ann');
                /** @enum */ exports.SomeEnum = { ENUM_CONSTANT: 'value' };

                // Not constants
                let letVariable = 'non-const';
                class MyClass { constructor() { /** @const {string} */ this.nonStatic = 'non-static'; } };
                /** @type {string} */ MyClass.staticButMutable = 'not @const, can be reassigned';
                const /** Set&lt;string&gt; */ mutableCollection = new Set();
                const /** ImmutableSet&lt;SomeMutableType&gt; */ mutableElements = ImmutableSet.of(mutable);
                const Foo = goog.require('my.Foo'); // mirrors imported name
                const logger = log.getLogger('loggers.are.not.immutable');
            </code>
            <p>
                Constants’ names are typically nouns or noun phrases.

        <section id="Camel_case_defined" class="main-section">
            <header>Camel case defined</header>
            <p>
                Sometimes there is more than one reasonable way to convert an English phrase into camel case,
                such as when acronyms or unusual constructs like IPv6 or iOS are present.
                To improve predictability, Google Style specifies the following (nearly) deterministic scheme.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beginning with the prose form of the name:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Convert the phrase to plain ASCII and remove any apostrophes. For example, Müller's algorithm might
                    become Muellers algorithm.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Divide this result into words, splitting on spaces and any remaining punctuation (typically hyphens).
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Recommended: if any word already has a conventional camel case appearance in common usage,
                            split this into its constituent parts (e.g., AdWords becomes ad words).
                            Note that a word such as iOS is not really in camel case per se; it defies any convention,
                            so this recommendation does not apply.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now lowercase everything (including acronyms), then uppercase only the first character of:
                    <ul>
                        <li>… each word, to yield upper camel case, or</li>
                        <li>… each word, to yield upper camel case, or</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, join all the words into a single identifier.
                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
