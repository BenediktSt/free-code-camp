        <div id="quote">
            Thousands of people have come together to demand justice for Alan Turing and recognition of the appalling
            way he was treated.
            While Turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we can't put the clock back,
            his treatment was of course utterly unfair and I am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry I and
            we all are for what happened to him ...
            So on behalf of the British government, and all those who live freely thanks to Alan's work I am very proud
            to say: we're sorry, you deserved so much better.
